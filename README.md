# Responsive-Portfolio

This code is my first rendezvous into using Bootstrap. I have come a long way since then! One lesson I learned is that if you want to use a library such as Bootstrap or jQuery, start from scratch.

With this project, I tried using previous code and adding Bootstrap features to it. That was very difficult and I would not recommend it.
