        <p>
        I was born in Lakewood, Ohio on May 31, 1991. I've been a longtime Cleveland sports fan (except for the Browns, oddly enough) and I especially love the Cleveland Indians.
        </p>

        <p>
        After graduating from Cleveland State University cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics, I was not sure what to do with my life. I was working at the downtown casino at the time as a cashier and worked my way into the Finance department. After being promoted to Senior Accountant, I began to realize that finance and accounting were not my callings in life.

        I discovered coding and became very interested. However, I did not exactly know where to start. After a lackluster semester of online Tri-C courses in computer science, my lovely wife discovered a coding boot camp at Case Western Reserve University. After just two days in the program, I instantly feel in love with coding!
        </p>

        <p>
        Since then, I have created various coding projects with my own ten fingertips. Anyone can see these creations in the portfolio page for this website. Thank you for visiting my website, the first major project of mine! And please come back to this website every once in a while to see what new projects I have completed or I am working on.
